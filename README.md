This is a project where I made a functioning shell in c for linux. I used a cool page that, unfortunately, I forgot.
It was very useful as I got to learn about the ins and outs of linux and how the shell actually operates. It was very
interesting and I would recommend everyone who's interested in how a linux shell and command line works to make their
own. It was very fun and I really enjoyed it.

command for making an executable in compilation: gcc -o shell shell.c

how to run the executable: ./shell
